After a solid 18 months of faff, learning what I didn't know and spending many hours of frustration googling how to move a line 10 pixels, I've finally got a website to show the world!

<br>

I'm going to keep this introduction brief as my first attempt at a blog post started off as a strange hybrid between a messy soliloquy and an engineering report. After asking my housemate to review it, I was informed that generally speaking, when writing a blog you should try and connect with your readers. Point taken...

<br>

Thus my first lesson learnt from writing a blog is that I'm not very good at writing blogs.

<br>

Nevertheless, what's cooking you ask?

<br>

Well, after I've scrubbed up my writing skills a little, I'm going to post a few articles on 'learning a second language'. I'm currently in Madrid studying Spanish and earlier in 2018 I spent four months in Xi'an giving Mandarin a whirl.

<br>

The articles will be super helpful for anyone taking up a second language in another country and not sure where to start. Without a doubt, those first few months after taking up the challenge will be your biggest minefield and the goal of the 3 part blog series will be to help you navigate the early pitfalls that a lot of people (110% myself included) frequently stumble into. 

<br>

Part 1 will focus on setting yourself up in your target country and Part 2 and 3 are focused around the usually rather dull subject of planning and execution. If my guidance in the articles still doesn't float your langauge learning boat I can at least promise some of my case studies from China and Spain will make you laugh at me or with me.

<br>

In the meantime I hope to post Part 2 of this welcome soon which will give a little more context behind why I'm here and what the heck has been going on the past two years! I'll try and steer it away from either an engineering report or soliloquy, you have my word.

<br>

Look forward to checking in with you soon x
