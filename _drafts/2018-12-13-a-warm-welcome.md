After a solid 18 months of faff and spending many hours of frustration googling how to move a line 10 pixels, I’ve finally got a website to show the world!

<br>

I’m going to keep this introduction brief as my first attempt at a blog post started off as a strange hybrid between a soliloquy and an engineering report. After asking my housemate to review it, I was informed that generally speaking, when writing a blog you should try and connect with your readers. Point taken…

<br>

Thus my first lesson learnt from writing a blog is that I’m not very good at writing blogs.

<br>

Nevertheless, what’s in the works?

<br>

Well, after I’ve scrubbed up my writing skills a little, I’m going to post a few articles on ‘learning a second language’. I’m currently in Madrid studying Spanish and earlier in 2018 I spent four months in Xi’an giving Mandarin a whirl.

<br>

I found the early stages of settling into a foreign country pretty challenging and ‘wasted’ a lot of time before setting up a platform from which I could be successful with my language studies. 

<br>

The goal of the articles will be to stimulate some early thinking and minimise downtime and frustrations when planning a language learning project. I’ll be heeding my own advice during my time in Madrid so we’ll have a good reference point to see if my suggestions work!

<br>
 
In the meantime I’ll be throwing out some reflections on whether supplementing my diet has improved my energy levels and I hope to post Part 2 of this welcome soon which will give a little more context behind why I’m here and what the heck has been going on the past two years! I’ll try and steer it away from either an engineering report or soliloquy, you have my word.

<br>
 
Look forward to checking in with you soon x
