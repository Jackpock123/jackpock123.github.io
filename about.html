			<h3 class="text-underline-left">About me.</h3>
			<p>Hi world, I’m Joe from Milton Keynes, England. A Chartered Civil Engineer CEng MICE (had to drop the letters) who is exploring DJing, programming and learning Spanish and Chinese. I started my Engineering career in Dubai in August 2012 and since then have been lucky enough to call places like Xi’an, Da Nang and Berlin my home.<br><br>
			

			After spending over four years in Dubai, in December 2016 I quit my job to embark on a quest to rediscover and develop an identity that I’d lost touch with along the way. I’ll be honest, I didn’t have much of a plan, apart from a deep desire to explore something different to my status quo. I wanted to switch off autopilot and investigate a frustrating brain fog which had developed towards my latter 20s.<br><br>

			I knew at the core of the desire was a need to learn and create, and develop skills which enabled me to contribute in a world that was evolving at a crazy speed.<br><br>

			After bouncing around for nearly two years, trying out a couple of things and making a fair few mistakes, I feel like it's time to document some of the thoughts that accompanied me on this journey. Sharing experiences and tools gathered along the way and shedding light on the ridiculous decision making (or lack of) I still seem to possess at 29.<br><br>

			I’m interested in the themes of exploration, creativity and health and I'm going to expand on what these wonderfully abstract topics mean to me <a href="/blog.html">here</a>.<br><br>

			Right now I’m focusing on the exploration part, living in Madrid with two wonderful housemates Monica and Ollie the Collie and pursuing my goal of being bilingual.<br><br>
