			<h3 class="text-underline-left">About me.</h3>
			<p>Hi world, I’m Joe from Milton Keynes, England. I’m a Chartered Civil Engineer CEng MICE (yes that makes me a geek), aspiring DJ, front end programmer and polyglot. Oh and not to forget  serial dreamer... I started my Engineering career in Dubai in August 2012 and since have been lucky enough to call places China, Vietnam, Germany and now Spain my home.<br><br>

			After spending four years in Dubai, in December 2016 it quit my job to embark on a quest to rediscover and develop an identity that I’d lost somewhere along the way. I’ll be honest, I didn’t have much of a plan, apart from a deep desire to explore something different. No more autopilot, no more fogginess and no more feeling like a passenger who was drifting at 40% of capacity through life.<br><br>

			I knew at the core of the desire was a need to learn and create, and develop skills which enabled me to contribute in a world which was evolving faster than I could keep up.<br><br>

			After bouncing around for nearly two years, making shit loads of mistakes and having some of the best and worst times; I feel like I’m in a place where I can contribute some value back to the world using this platform. Sharing some experiences, tools gathered along the way and hopefully a few laughs when you realise how much of complete sausage I am.<br><br>
