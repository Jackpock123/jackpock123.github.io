		<h3 class="text-underline">About me.</h3>
		<p>Hi world, I’m Joe from Milton Keynes, England. In 2017 after 4.5 years in Dubai I left a career in Civil Engineering to explore places and ideas that had been calling out to me. Things like learning a second language and how to code, visiting Latin America and teaching myself how to DJ.<br><br>

		In the last three years I've been able to call places like Xi’an, Berlin, Madrid and most recently Bucaramanga my home. The unique experiences in each city allowed me to focus on developing a new skill and ask myself the important question of where I wanted to grow and contribute in the next phase of my professional life.<br><br>

		This year I've been building towards applying for a coding bootcamp in London, which I'm hoping will provide the platform to help me find a role as a junior developer.<br><br>

		The website you see started out as a blank canvas and is essentially a place to create, experiment and express myself.<br><br>

		You can check out some of my thoughts <a href="/blog.html">here</a> and if you'd like to know more about my interests click on the dropdowns.</p>

			<p>Becoming bilingual has become a huge passion project of mine. Seeing the joy and infinite opportunity that communcation can unlock all over the world was and continues to be one of my biggest inspirations.<br><br>

			After a 3 month secondment in Xi'an in 2015, I vowed to return to take on Mandarin and arrived for four months in winter 2018, passing my HSK2.<br><br>

			However, autumn 2017 saw me fall in love with Spanish during my travels around Latin America and in November 2018 I relocated to Madrid to immerse myself in the language, eventually settling back in Colombia for a few months in July this year.<br><br>

			I've absolutely loved the process of learning through immersion and driving my own study. Instead of traditional classroom based learning I worked with a personal tutor to study situations such as dining out, directing a taxi driver or dating.<br><br>

			This contextual learning approach has been so effective for me, in a month I was able to confidently use Spanish in important situations in Madrid (ordering tapas and beer) and my confidence skyrocketed.<br><br>

			I believe confidence is everything when learning another language and that using your daily experiences to dictate what phrases you need to learn is the best way to improve it rapidly.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible-button">Coding: OneMonth</button>
		<div class="collapsible-button-content">
			<p>For the last 2.5 years I've been developing my coding skills as a hobby, testing to see if I was passionate about a career in developing.<br><br>

			I started out my coding journey with <a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/html" target="_blank"> OneMonth's HTML & CSS Bootcamp</a> and since then have:</p>

			<ul class="content-list">
				<li>Used Jekyll (Ruby, Markdown and Liquid) to build this website</li>
				<li>Completed the<a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/javascript" target="_blank"> OneMonth JavaScript Bootcamp</a></li>
				<li>Learnt Flexbox and CSS Grids with Scrimba</li>
				<li>Added a carousel, tabs and a responsive navigation bar to my website with JavaScript</li>
			</ul>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible-button">Music: Berlin & elektronischemusik</button>
		<div class="collapsible-button-content">

			<p>It was a dream of mine for many years to learn how to DJ. I decided to combine that dream with another life goal of spending some time in Berlin during summer and in August 2018 off I went to Germany for two months to be swept away by the inspiration and energy of the coolest city in the world.<br><br>

			[Disclaimer: Aparently it's cooler to say you're not a DJ in Berlin]<br><br>

			I got way more than I anticipated, and in addition to satisfying a goal of recording my <a href="/music.html" target="_blank">first mixtape</a> came agonisingly close to playing out for the first time (in a super sick venue) and enrolled in a digital production course with elektronischemusik.<br><br>

			I'm a pretty analytical and engineeringy person and have to say the three day course was a complete game changer for me in terms of viewing the creative process, rubbing shoulders with legit and talented musicians and just the way I listen to music.<br><br>

			The last year this dream has been put on ice whilst I studied Spanish but in 2020 I hope to get back to it and make some new mixes which don't hurt the ears too much.

		<div class="collapsible-button-content">

			<p>When leaving Dubai I had a strong desire to explore new places, push myself outside of my comfort zone and hopefully in the process of getting lost have a few experiences that I'd remember for a long time.<br><br>

			Some of the most memorable experiences include volunteering in Vietnam, backpacking though South and Central America and attending weddings in Ireland, Spain and Colombia. You can check out some of the snaps <a href="/travel.html">here</a>.
