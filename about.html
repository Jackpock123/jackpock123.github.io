			<p>Hi world, I’m Joe from Milton Keynes, England. A Chartered Civil Engineer CEng MICE (had to get that in) who is exploring DJing, programming and learning Spanish and Chinese. I started my Engineering career in Dubai in August 2012 and since then have been lucky enough to call places like Xi’an, Da Nang and Berlin my home.<br><br>

			Right now I’m Living in Madrid with my two wonderful housemates Monica and Ollie the Collie and am focusing on learning the beautiful language that is Spanish.<br><br>

			After spending four years in Dubai, in December 2016 I quit my job to embark on a quest to rediscover and develop an identity that I’d left somewhere along the way. I’ll be honest, I didn’t have much of a plan, apart from a deep desire to explore something different to my status quo. It was time to switch off autopilot and investigate means to rid myself of a frustrating brain fog which had developed towards my latter 20s.<br><br>

			I knew at the core of the desire was a need to learn and create, and develop skills which enabled me to contribute in a world which was evolving faster than I could keep up.<br><br>

			After bouncing around for nearly two years, trying out a couple of things and making a fair few mistakes… I feel like I’m in a place where I can speak about it. Sharing experiences, tools gathered along the way and hopefully a few laughs at the ridiculous decision making (or lack of) I still seem to possess at 29.<br><br>

			Right now I’m interested in the themes of exploration, creativity and health. Exploration through learning and pushing the boundaries of our physical and spiritual selves. Creativity through the search and stimulation of things we are passionate about. And health, how to build the best body and mind so we can optimise this life thing.<br><br>

			With these wonderfully abstract topics in mind I'm going to write some stuff and share it on this flashy new website.<br><br>
