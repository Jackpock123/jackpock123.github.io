			<h4 class="underline" id="jump-html">HTML & CSS Bootcamp</h4>
			<p>In May 2017 I jumped into coding with the<a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/html" target="_blank"> OneMonth HTML & CSS Bootcamp</a>. I wanted to build my own website without pre-built templates and sensed an opportunity to start my coding journey.</p>

			<p>OneMonth courses use project based learning and I completed four assignments; building static webpages for a<a href="/portfolio/monthly-resolutions/index.html" target="_blank"> Monthly Resolutions blog</a>, my<a href="/portfolio/woodland-wedding/index.html" target="_blank"> mother's wedding</a> and a clone of a Air BnB profile<a href="/portfolio/aircnc/index-flex.html" target="_blank"> AirCnC</a> for sharing dogs.</p>

			<h4 class="underline" id="jump-jekyll">Jekyll</h4>
			<p>I realised quickly that if I wanted blogging functionality for my website, having to hardcode every new post would be inefficient and messy when updating the website. I discovered Jekyll, a framework that generates static and blog-aware sites and even better let me host a website for free on GitHub.</p>

			<p>Jekyll is written in Ruby, and allowed me to build my static website from dynamic components such as templates, liquid code and markdown. I made some basic sketches of the website and using the tutorials from<a href="https://learn.cloudcannon.com/" target="_blank"> cloudcannon</a> and skills from the OneMonth bootcamp started to build my website from scratch.</p>

			<p>During this time, I also learnt how to use Flexbox and CSS Grids on Scrimba.</p>

			<p>I'm a big fan of Jekyll, and in the process leading up to pushing my first build on GitHub in December 2018 I learnt:</p>

			<h4 class="underline" id="jump-javascript">JavaScript OneMonth Bootcamp</h4>

			<p>After completing the required JavaScript prerequisites on freeCodeCamp for F&C, I wanted to develop my understanding of JavaScript using contextual learning and a project based approach so in August 2019 I enrolled in the<a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/javascript" target="_blank"> OneMonth JavaScript Bootcamp</a>.</p>

			<p>I built four applications: <a target="_blank" href="portfolio/theroyals-final/index.html"> a Randomizer App,</a><a target="_blank" href="portfolio/giphy-search/index.html"> a Giphy App</a>, <a target="_blank" href="portfolio/soundcloud-player/index.html"> a SoundCloud App</a> and <a target="_blank" href="portfolio/rugbystats/index.html"> a data visualization exercise</a>.</p>

			<p>A little background of what I've been up to previously.</p>

			<h4 class="underline">Civil Engineering</h4>
			<p>In August 2012 I started my career as a civil engineer in Atkins Dubai based Ground Engineering team and was fortunate to work on some incredible multi-billion dollar projects including<a href="https://corp.qr.com.qa/English/Projects/Pages/DohaMetro.aspx" target="_blank"> Doha Metro</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh_Metro" target="_blank"> Riyadh Metro</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai_Opera" target="_blank">Dubai Opera House</a>.</p>

			<p>My proudest achievement would be undertaking the Assistant Project Manager role on Doha Metro's Gold Line, being responsible for a budget of over £1.3m and leading a team of over 40 people spread across three design centres in Dubai, Doha and Manila.</p>

			<p>Working in Xi'an for one of China's most prestigious rail design institutes (FSDI) a subsidiary of China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) was also a super cool experience.</p>

			<p>In December 2016 after 4.5 years of professional development and a successful professional review I became a chartered member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_Engineer_(UK)" target="_blank">CEng</a><a href="https://www.ice.org.uk/about-ice" target="_blank"> MICE</a>).</p>

			</div>

			<h4 class="underline">Exploration & Travel</h4>
			<p>In January 2017 I left my role in Dubai and set out to develop other skills which has seen me volunteer in Da Nang, take a music production course in Berlin, backpack through Latin America and take big steps towards being fluent in a second langauge whilst studying Mandarin in Xi'an and Spanish in Madrid and Bucaramanga.</p>

			<div class="fc-image">
				<img  src="">
			</div>

			<h4 class="underline">Spanish</h4>
			<p>For the last two years learning a second language has been my main passion project. Seeing how much opportunity and joy is available through communicating with different cultures has served as a huge source of inspiration and completely revitalized me a person.</p>

			<p>My learning process has been based on immersion, after passing my HSK2 in Mandarin I focused my attention on Spanish and through basing myself in Spain and Colombia am currently practising a B2 level.</p>

			<div class="fc-image">
				<img  src="">
			</div>

			<h4 class="underline">Preparing for Founders & Coders</h4>
			<p>Since July 2019 I have been based out of Bucaramanga, Colombia. My goal has been to continue advancing my Spanish whilst preparing the best possible application for the F&C bootcamp and taking additional courses on OneMonth so that I can add the most value during the course and beyond.</p> -->

			<h3>Interests</h3>

			<p>Thoughts on where I would like to take my coding career.</p>

			<!-- <ul class="content-list">
				<li>Transportation</li>
				<li>Sustainability & Natural Resources</li>
				<li>Efficiency</li>
				<li>Fostering the Creative Industry</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 class="underline">Transportation</h4>
			<p>Having had the majority of my professional experience in the transportation sector I have a fascination with how people move from a to b and how mental and physical health is affected by stress factors such a journey duration, traffic and pollution.</p>

			<p>The infrastructure of many of my favourite cities in the world is being pushed to the limit and a believe we have the technology and know how to do better. I would love to combine my coding, technical engineering and project management skills together to work with a team whose vision it is to improve the environmental or social experience of getting from a to b.</p>

			<div class="fc-image">
				<img  src="">
			</div>

			<h4 class="underline">Sustainable Development & Natural Resources</h4>
			<p>With the world population booming the conservation and maintainance of natural resources and their distribution networks are becoming critically important. Historically we have been very wasteful creatures but with the rise of the sharing economy and new monitoring tools we have an exciting opportunity to use what we have more efficiently.</p>

			<p>Better explained with an example? I remember being super excited by<a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/features/digital-vineyards/" target="_blank"> this exhibit</a> in Melbourne a few years ago. The crux of the challenge was not the collection of data but building a platform with which the average farmer could understand and make use of it. Now that's a cool project!</p>

			<div class="fc-image">
				<img  src="">
			</div>

			<h4 class="underline">Efficiency</h4>
			<p>During my experience in the construction industry I grew frustrated with how many simple and repeatable tasks were not automated. It wasn't uncommon to spend a day (honestly you could spend a week...) entering data from one file to another or snipping outputs from a software to use in a report.</p>

			<p>Engineers and architects have precious time taken away from areas in which they can make real impact: by innovating and adding value to designs by improving safety, reducing economic and environmental impacts and delivering a product or service which maximises it's potential benefits to society.</p>

			<p>There is so much that can be done with regards to managing contracts, payment mechanisms and using data and this style of wastefulness is not unique to the construction industry.</p>

			<div class="fc-image">
				<img  src="">
			</div>

			<h4 class="underline">Creativity</h4>
			<p>There is so much undiscovered talent out there for everyone to enjoy. Whether you like theatre, live music or dance. People are putting their art out there but if you don't know the right channels it can be difficult to find.</p>

			<p>I'd love to create a network or platform which both empowers people to share their art and helps others to find it.</p> -->
