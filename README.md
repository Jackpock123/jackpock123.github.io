### Hi World

#### My first README using markdown.

P.s This is the repository for my application to FAC

Visit my application [here](https://jackpock123.github.io/)

The webpage has three sections:

1. Application 
2. Coding Journey
3. Background

Did you know that `inline code` has backticks around it **\`like this**\`.

Are you more of a..  
soft break or a 

hard break type of person?

**Here is a random quote**:

>_“There will come a time when you believe everything is finished. That will be the beginning.”_ - Louis L’Amour
>
>**_This is not part of the quote, it is just bold and italic text_**
