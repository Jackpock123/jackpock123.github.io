I"¹<p>After spending many hours of frustration googling how to move a line 10 pixels, Iâ€™ve finally built a website!</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to keep this introduction brief as my first attempt at a blog post started off as a strange hybrid between a collection of my meandering thoughts and an engineering report. After asking my housemate to review it, I was informed that generally speaking, when writing a blog you should try and connect with your readers. Point takenâ€¦</p>

<p>Thus my first lesson learnt from writing blog posts is that Iâ€™m not very good at writing blog posts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, what do I want to write about?</p>

<p>Well, after Iâ€™ve scrubbed up my writing skills a little, Iâ€™d like to share my thoughts on learning a second language. Iâ€™m currently in Madrid studying Spanish and earlier in 2018 I spent four months in Xiâ€™an giving Mandarin a go.</p>

<p>I found the early stages of settling into a foreign country pretty challenging and wasted a lot of time before setting up an effective process for learning.</p>

<p>The goal of the post will be will be to stimulate some early thinking for planning a language learning project.</p>

<p>Look forward to checking in with you soon x</p>
