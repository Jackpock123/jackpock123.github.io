                    <p>After working 4.5 years in the Middle East on complex<a href="https://corp.qr.com.qa/English/Projects/Pages/DohaMetro.aspx" target="_blank"> metro projects,</a>  my coding journey started in March 2017 with<a href="https://onemonth.com/courses" target="_blank"> OneMonth.</a></p>

                    <p>Since then I've developed Front End experience, completing OneMonth's<a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/html" target="_blank"> HTML & CSS Bootcamp,</a><a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/javascript" target="_blank"> JavaScript Bootcamp</a> and<a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/responsive-design" target="_blank"> Responsive Design</a> online course and used<a href="/home.html" target="_blank"> this website</a> to put into practice the skills I've learnt.</p>

                    <p>Having spent 2019 studying Spanish in Madrid and Colombia, I recently returned to the UK to submit my application for FAC's Spring Cohort 2020 and take a big step towards a career in web development.</p>                    
                </div>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible-button">Why Coding?</button>
                <div class="collapsible-button-content">
                    <p>Firstly I like building things :)</p>

                    <p>Having worked and trained as an Civil Engineer for 9 years; problem solving, product design and project delivery are a big part of my DNA.</p>

                    <p>I love the way coding presents an almost infinite number of ways to solve a problem and like engineering it is delivering a technical product or service which is fit for purpose and has the end user's experience in mind.</p>

                    <div class="content-image-collapsible">
                        <img  src="/images/fnc/unicorn.gif" alt="Riding unicorns whilst coding">
                    </div>
                    <h6 class="caption">A Civil Engineer after learning For Loops exist</h6>

                    <p class="italic">P.S I found this GIF with my<a href="/portfolio/giphy-search/index.html" target="_blank"> Giphy App</a>  which you can check out<a href="/portfolio/giphy-search/index.html" target="_blank"> here.</a></p>

                    <p>However, unlike in construction the tech industry can employ a MVP focused design approach, getting a product out there for feedback, iterating and moving quickly. This is something that excites me and the prospect of working in an agile environment is hugely appealing.</p>

                    <p>Building<a href="/home.html" target="_blank"> my website</a> from a blank slate has given me a freedom to express myself and I've really enjoyed the combination of creativity and logic and the modular style of learning coding requires, adding on and developing new skills depending on what I wanted to build.</p>

                    <p>Secondly, as an Engineer I also saw lots of opportunity in programming.</p>

                    <p>During my career in the Middle East there was so many tools that were crying out to be improved. Silly administrative tasks ate up hours of time and let's not talk about the tools we used to track project and contractual performance... I saw some things in Excel that should never be seen again (scarred for life...)</p>                    

                    <p>Quite often it seemed like a skills or knowledge gap left us using outdated or inefficient tools and it got me thinking how many other industries were there facing similar challenges in modernising or straight up reinventing the way they do business.</p>

                    <p>Even within the employment environment for legacy industries we are seeing new demand for different areas of expertise I feel like the developer skill set is going to be a huge demand for a long time to come.</p>                                  

                </div>


                <button type="button" class="collapsible-button">Why Founders & Coders?</button>
                <div class="collapsible-button-content">
                    <p>Project based learning is a huge draw for me. I love the practicality of it and I feel like this style of learning has helped me progress massively, not only with my coding but also in other areas of my life such as learning Spanish.</p>

                    <p>OneMonth's courses were project focused, requiring me to build something each week for grading. It was this practical application which really reinforced my learning and allowed me to see the bigger picture of why I was using specific code.</p>

                    <p>I built some cool stuff during the JavaScript Bootcamp which you can check out in the coding tab above.</p>

                    <div class="content-image-collapsible">

                    </div>
                    <h6 class="caption">SoundCloud create you own playlist App</h6> 

                    <p>I'm also drawn to the FAC ethos and culture. Since my first meetup I felt at home in an environment where everyone works together to improve. It was really rewarding partnering up to solve Kata and showed me the potential of peer-based learning when you place people with different skill sets and backgrounds together.</p>

                    <p>And of course it is really inspiring to see past alumni include people like the co-founder of Scrimba.</p>

                    <p>I'm serious about a career in web development so prospective employability is of huge importance to me. It appears as though employers value FAC graduates and it is cool that finding work after the 12 weeks is beneficial to both FAC and the students, aligning everyone towards a similar goal.</p>
                </div>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible-button">What have I learnt from the prerequisites?</button>
                <div class="collapsible-button-content">

                    <p>The process of designing and building this application into my website has been awesome and I learnt a lot adding in some Vanilla JavaScript to build collapsible buttons, a tab display, responsive navigation bar and<a href="/home.html" target="_blank"> image carousel.</a></p>

                    <p>My design approach was to make the most out of the single webpage requested from us in the application and reveal information gradually by using buttons with click events, (hopefully) preventing information overload for my audience.</p>

                    <p>Although not required, enrolling in the OneMonth Javacript Bootcamp in August 2019 really boosted my understanding of what JavaScript can do using AJAX calls to APIs and helped provide some context to what I'd learnt on freeCodeCamp.</p>

                    <p>It also contrasted nicey with the learning objectives of Codewars, where I found the challenges centered around using specific technical skills to solve problems with different data types.</p>

                    <p>Solving Kata brings a real sense of accomplishment and it was so fufilling when done in a team during the pairing sessions.</p>

                    <h6 class="caption">How I feel after solving Kata</h6>

                    <p>I found the Training JS and Coding Meetup series by myjinxin2015 and PiotrBerebecki very useful for learning fundamental but yet powerful JS methods such as map(), filter(), reduce() and split() and using E6 features such as arrow functions.</p>

                    <p>Overall, although not typical learning takeway, one of my favourite parts of completing the prerequisites has been attending the meetups and meeting fellow applicants, mentors and course coordinators all hungry to improve and help eachother. There's a great energy in Space4 and I would love to base myself there with the FAC family come March 2020.</p>

                <p>Elevator pitch incoming!</p>                

                <p>Since starting out with programming it's become more apparent to me that my experience in technical design and project delivery helps to provide a strong foundation to launch a career in coding.</p>

                <p>Working to high technical standards and following strict quality assurance processes was a fundamental part of my previous role and I'd like to think I'd thrive in a multidisciplinary tech environment.</p>

                <p>I've learnt so much already this year just by applying to the course and I'm hungry and excited to contribute positively as part of the FAC family, working to deliver progressive social projects on behalf of Tech for Better and FAC affiliated companies.</p>

                <p>Uncertainty is something I actively seek out and this has led to working in diverse teams accross the Middle East and Northwest China.</p>

                <p>Although it's uncertain where my coding career will end up, I'm really hoping it will start with you guys!</p>

            <p>In May 2017 I jumped into coding with the<a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/html" target="_blank"> OneMonth HTML & CSS Bootcamp</a>. I wanted to build my own website without pre-built templates and sensed an opportunity to start my coding journey.</p>

            <p>OneMonth courses use project based learning and I completed four assignments; building static webpages for a<a href="/portfolio/monthly-resolutions/index.html" target="_blank"> Monthly Resolutions blog</a>, my<a href="/portfolio/woodland-wedding/index.html" target="_blank"> mother's wedding</a> and a clone of a Air BnB profile called<a href="/portfolio/aircnc/index-flex.html" target="_blank"> AirCnC</a> for sharing dogs.</p>

            <h4 class="underline" id="jump-jekyll">Jekyll</h4>
            <p>I realised quickly that if I wanted blogging functionality for my website, having to hardcode every new post would be inefficient and messy when updating the website. I discovered Jekyll, a framework that generates static and blog-aware sites which let me host my website for free on GitHub.</p>

            <p>Jekyll is written in Ruby, and allowed me to build my static website from dynamic components such as templates, liquid code and markdown. I made some basic sketches of the website and using the tutorials from<a href="https://learn.cloudcannon.com/" target="_blank"> cloudcannon</a> and skills from the OneMonth bootcamp started to build my website from scratch.</p>

            <p>During this time, I also learnt how to use Flexbox and CSS Grids on Scrimba (it's very cool that Per was part of FAC in 2015).</p>

            <p>I'm a big fan of Jekyll, and in the process leading up to commiting my first build on GitHub in December 2018 I learnt:</p>

            <p>After completing the required JavaScript prerequisites on freeCodeCamp for F&C, I wanted to develop my understanding of JavaScript using a project based approach so in August 2019 I enrolled in the<a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/javascript" target="_blank"> OneMonth JavaScript Bootcamp</a>.</p>

            <p>I built four applications:<a target="_blank" href="portfolio/theroyals-final/index.html"> a Randomizer App,</a><a target="_blank" href="portfolio/giphy-search/index.html"> a Giphy App</a>, <a target="_blank" href="portfolio/soundcloud-player/index.html"> a SoundCloud App</a> and <a target="_blank" href="portfolio/rugbystats/index.html"> a data visualization exercise</a>.</p>

            <h4 class="underline" id="jump-summary">Building out this website and beyond</h4>

            <p>Using the additional skills in JavaScript and CSS I completely recoded my website to tidy up the code, add extra functionality and content, improve the styling and responsive design and built new sections. Most importantly the FAC one you see here! :)</p>

            <p>I also took the OneMonth Responsive Design Course in October 2019.</p>

            <p>Details of what I've added to this website using Vanilla JavaScript are provided below:</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>

            <p>A little background of what I've been up to previously.</p>

            <!-- <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Civil Engineering</li>
                <li>Exploration & Travel</li>

                <li>Preparing for F&C</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="underline">Civil Engineering</h4>
            <p>In August 2012 I started my career as a civil engineer in Atkins Dubai based Ground Engineering team and was fortunate to work on some incredible multi-billion dollar projects including<a href="https://corp.qr.com.qa/English/Projects/Pages/DohaMetro.aspx" target="_blank"> Doha Metro</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh_Metro" target="_blank"> Riyadh Metro</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai_Opera" target="_blank">Dubai Opera House</a>.</p>

            <p>My proudest achievement would be undertaking the Assistant Project Manager role on Doha Metro's Gold Line, being responsible for a budget of over £1.3m and leading a team of over 40 people spread across three design centres in Dubai, Doha and Manila.</p>

            <p>Working in Xi'an for one of China's most prestigious rail design institutes (FSDI) a subsidiary of China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) was also a super cool experience.</p>

            <p>In December 2016 after 4.5 years of professional development and a successful professional review I became a chartered member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_Engineer_(UK)" target="_blank">CEng</a><a href="https://www.ice.org.uk/about-ice" target="_blank"> MICE</a>).</p>

            </div>

            <h4 class="underline">Exploration & Travel</h4>
            <p>In January 2017 I left my role in Dubai and set out to develop other skills which has seen me volunteer in Da Nang, take a music production course in Berlin, backpack through Latin America and take big steps towards being fluent in a second langauge whilst studying Mandarin in Xi'an and Spanish in Madrid and Bucaramanga.</p>

            <h4 class="underline">Spanish</h4>
            <p>For the last two years learning a second language has been my main passion project. Seeing how much opportunity and joy is available through communicating with different cultures has served as a huge source of inspiration and completely revitalized me a person.</p>

            <p>My learning process has been based on immersion, after passing my HSK2 in Mandarin I focused my attention on Spanish and through basing myself in Spain and Colombia am currently practising a B2 level.</p>

            <h4 class="underline">Preparing for Founders & Coders</h4>
            <p>Since July 2019 I have been based out of Bucaramanga, Colombia. My goal has been to continue advancing my Spanish whilst preparing the best possible application for the F&C bootcamp and taking additional courses on OneMonth so that I can add the most value during the course and beyond.</p> -->

        <div id="tab-content-4" class="tabcontent">
            <h3>Interests</h3>

            <p>Thoughts on where I would like to take my coding career.</p>

            <!-- <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Transportation</li>
                <li>Sustainability & Natural Resources</li>
                <li>Efficiency</li>
                <li>Fostering the Creative Industry</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="underline">Transportation</h4>
            <p>Having had the majority of my professional experience in the transportation sector I have a fascination with how people move from a to b and how mental and physical health is affected by stress factors such a journey duration, traffic and pollution.</p>

            <p>The infrastructure of many of my favourite cities in the world is being pushed to the limit and a believe we have the technology and know how to do better. I would love to combine my coding, technical engineering and project management skills together to work with a team whose vision it is to improve the environmental or social experience of getting from a to b.</p>

            <div class="fc-image">
                <img  src="">
            </div>

            <h4 class="underline">Sustainable Development & Natural Resources</h4>
            <p>With the world population booming the conservation and maintainance of natural resources and their distribution networks are becoming critically important. Historically we have been very wasteful creatures but with the rise of the sharing economy and new monitoring tools we have an exciting opportunity to use what we have more efficiently.</p>

            <p>Better explained with an example? I remember being super excited by<a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/features/digital-vineyards/" target="_blank"> this exhibit</a> in Melbourne a few years ago. The crux of the challenge was not the collection of data but building a platform with which the average farmer could understand and make use of it. Now that's a cool project!</p>

            <div class="fc-image">
                <img  src="">
            </div>

            <h4 class="underline">Efficiency</h4>
            <p>During my experience in the construction industry I grew frustrated with how many simple and repeatable tasks were not automated. It wasn't uncommon to spend a day (honestly you could spend a week...) entering data from one file to another or snipping outputs from a software to use in a report.</p>

            <p>Engineers and architects have precious time taken away from areas in which they can make real impact: by innovating and adding value to designs by improving safety, reducing economic and environmental impacts and delivering a product or service which maximises it's potential benefits to society.</p>

            <p>There is so much that can be done with regards to managing contracts, payment mechanisms and using data and this style of wastefulness is not unique to the construction industry.</p>

            <div class="fc-image">
                <img  src="">
            </div>

            <h4 class="underline">Creativity</h4>
            <p>There is so much undiscovered talent out there for everyone to enjoy. Whether you like theatre, live music or dance. People are putting their art out there but if you don't know the right channels it can be difficult to find.</p>

            <p>I'd love to create a network or platform which both empowers people to share their art and helps others to find it.</p> -->
