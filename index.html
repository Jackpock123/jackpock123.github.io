                    <p>Hey I'm Joe, in a past life I used to be a professionally qualified Civil Engineer but three years ago I quit my job to explore new places and interests.</p>

                    <p>Along the way I started teaching myself to code using online resources and after seeing how much potential there was in coding for our world and personal growth, decided to take a leap of faith and develop my programming skills to the next level.</p>

                    <p>Having spent 2019 studying Spanish in Madrid and Colombia, I recently returned to the UK to attend the FAC meetups and submit my application for the Spring Cohort 2020.</p>                                        
                </div>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible-button">Why Coding?</button>
                <div class="collapsible-button-content">

                    <p>In the last three years I’ve been obsessed with learning and diversifying my skill set.</p>

                    <p>When I left my job after 4.5 years in December in 2016, I promised myself that I would scratch the itch and explore interests that had been neglected during my professional career.</p>                    

                    <p>I left the role because I had reached the milestone of becoming a professionally qualified Civil Engineer but was at a crossroads as I couldn’t see a fulfilling future for me there.</p>

                    <p>The construction industry is typically slow moving, with little money to reinvest in Research and Development and new capabilities. I felt this had rubbed off on me personally, and I realised if I didn’t invest in myself to keep my skill set fresh and relevant the rapidly technologizing world would leave me behind.</p>

                    <p>One of the itchiest itches was a desire to learn how to code.</p>

                    <div class="content-image-collapsible">
                        <img  src="/images/fnc/soundcloud-app.PNG" alt="SoundCloud application to create playlists">
                    </div>
                    <h6 class="caption">Try out the SoundCloud App I built during self-study and completing the prerequisites <span class="text-pulse"><a href=""> here.</a></span></h6>

                    <p>At this point all I knew was that I wanted to build a website and maybe after I could learn some skills to build some useful stuff for the construction industry (more on this in a moment).</p>

                    <p>And so, my journey of self-learning started out with the online course provider OneMonth’s<a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/html" target="_blank"> HTML & CSS course</a> and I started building a personal website to put into practice what I’d learnt.</p>

                    <div class="content-image">
                        <img  src="/images/fnc/jekyll-website.PNG" alt="Homepage of personal website first push">

                    <h6 class="caption">Check out my personal website<span class="text-pulse"><a href="/home.html"> here.</a></span></h6>

                    <p>The process was truly empowering. I loved how it allowed me to express myself creatively and learn new skills based on what I wanted to do with my website. After learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, this modular learning style allowed me to gain relevant skills quickly and put them to use.</p>

                    <p>There is a really clear connect with the amount of time you invest in coding and what it gives you back. It's a hugely rewarding feedback loop and after seeing how much I was learning and improving I became hooked.</p>                    

                    <p>On the practical side of why I’m interested in coding, I saw a lot of opportunities in the construction industry where the skillset could add value.</p>

                    <div class="content-image-collapsible">

                    <p class="italic">P.S I found this GIF with my<a href="/portfolio/giphy-search/index.html" target="_blank"> Giphy App</a>  which you can try out<a href="/portfolio/giphy-search/index.html" target="_blank"> here.</a></p>

                    <p>Earlier I mentioned how construction is slow moving and it likes using standardisation and repeatability to reduce costs. The problem with doing things the way they’ve always been done is that you tend to stagnate and miss opportunities to innovate.</p>

                    <p>A big missed opportunity in construction is project and commercial management.   Simply put, the tools are dated and require a huge amount of manpower and capital to run. Resulting in inaccurate information and making company fees uncompetitive as these costs have to be paid for by the client.</p>

                    <p>Most importantly when capital and resources are being gobbled up with time consuming administrative tasks, they’re not being allocated to areas which can add value, like improving the actual product their selling.</p>                    

                    <p>With regards to construction, these resources could facilitate better value engineering, essentially making a leaner product with less economic and environmental impact. For example: do we need that much concrete? Are we using the right grade of steel? Can the metro station be two levels instead of three?</p>

                    <p>These are the type of questions we should be asking and I believe that technology can free up more time and resources to do so.</p>                    

                    <p>And this is just the one industry I’ve been exposed to. I can imagine there are many more facing the same challenge.</p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible-button">Why Founders & Coders?</button>
                <div class="collapsible-button-content">

                    <p>In the 5 meetups I attended at Space4 I felt really at home. There was a real sense of inclusivity for people from all backgrounds and the friendly and helpful manner of the mentors and coordinators rubbed off on everyone in the room.</p>

                    <p>I get a real energy from connecting with people from different backgrounds and the desire to push myself outside of my comfort zone has seen me relocate to the Middle East after graduating from university, work and study Mandarin in a tier two city in China and move to Madrid and South America to learn Spanish.</p>

                    <h6 class="caption">SoundCloud create you own playlist App</h6>

                    <p>The prospect of teaching future cohorts is very exciting. Not only will it reinforce my learning but give me the opportunity to give back and add momentum to the virtuous cycle of collective and self-improvement.</p>

                    <p>Peer-led learning is unique in that everyone in the cohort is incentivised to contribute to a proactive and collaborative environment because there is not necessarily going to be a teacher to give you all the answers.</p>                    

                    <p>The more you contribute, the more you’ll get out and the journey will be richer for everyone collectively.</p>

                    <p>I love supporting others in their development and the chance to be a part of a group going through a journey where you’re all vested in each other's development is invigorating and strengthens my desire to be more involved in the FAC community.</p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible-button">What have I learnt from the prerequisites?</button>
                <div class="collapsible-button-content">

                    <p class="underline">Technical takeaways</p>

                    <p>The process of building this application has been awesome and I learnt a lot using JavaScript to build collapsible buttons, a tab display, a responsive navigation bar and an image carousel.</p>

                    <p>I took the decision to enroll in OneMonth’s<a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/javascript" target="_blank"> JavaScript course</a> in August after struggling with freeCodeCamp and it helped provide a much clearer picture of the fundamentals of JavaScript and what it can be used for. Such as what is an API and why would we want to make calls to it.</p>

                    <p>The JavaScript course's learning objectives contrasted nicely with those of Codewars, where the challenges centered more around using specific technical skills to solve problems with different data types.</p>

                    <p>The Training JS and Coding Meetup series by myjinxin2015 and PiotrBerebecki were very useful for learning fundamental but yet powerful JS methods such as map(), filter(), reduce() and split() and using E6 features such as arrow functions.</p>

                    <p class="underline">Takeaways from the design process</p>

                    <p>Designing the user journey was a valuable exercise and I learnt the importance of establishing a hierarchy of information and removing content that distracted from the story I wanted to tell my audience.</p>

                    <p>I received feedback that my first layout contained too much information and was disorientating because it had lots of links to my personal website. Late in the design process I decided to separate out my application almost completely in an attempt to make the user journey more linear.</p>

                    <p>Don’t write copy in your text editor! Refreshing web pages to see each tiny update is a sure way to fry your brain and give you writers block!</p>

                    <p>Make commits more frequently and with useful notes. Originally I was definitely guilty of committing infrequently and with many changes, preferring to use the Jekyll developing platform to review changes locally. When GitHub Desktop stopped working, it gave me a real fright as I had no record of what I’d changed and had to check each file and folder individually. </p>

                    <p class="underline">Takeaways from peer-led learning</p>

                    <p>One of my favourite aspects of completing the prerequisites has been attending the meetups and working with fellow applicants to solve kata. It’s really rewarding and there was definitely some fist pump moments!</p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible-button">Why me?</button>
                <div class="collapsible-button-content">      

                <p>I've learnt so much already this year just by applying to the course and it has really reinforced my commitment to a career in professional development.</p>

                <p>The chance to grow and develop in a team united around similar goals is really motivating and I’m excited at the prospect of what our cohort a can achieve both during and beyond the 12 weeks.</p>

                <p>I strongly believe we can make the world a better place by building tools that make better use the resources we have, reduce inefficiency and empower people to create and innovate. In construction alone, I've seen much opportunity to do so and I feel technologizing our industries is a great challenge for our generation.</p>

                <p>With my previous experience working in a strict delivery environment to high technical standards, I feel like I have a lot to offer the team in terms of leadership, following process and cultivating a healthy working environment.</p>

            <h4 class="underline" id="jump-html">HTML & CSS Course</h4>
            <p>In May 2017 I jumped into coding with the<a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/html" target="_blank"> OneMonth HTML & CSS online course</a> as I wanted to build my own website without pre-built templates.</p>

            <p>OneMonth courses use project based learning and I completed four assignments; building simple static webpages for a<a href="/portfolio/monthly-resolutions/index.html" target="_blank"> Monthly Resolutions blog</a>, my<a href="/portfolio/woodland-wedding/index.html" target="_blank"> mother's wedding</a> and a clone of a Air BnB profile called<a href="/portfolio/aircnc/index-flex.html" target="_blank"> AirCnC</a> for sharing dogs.</p>

            <h4 class="underline" id="jump-jekyll">Jekyll</h4>
            <p>I realised quickly that if I wanted blogging functionality for my website, having to hardcode every new post would be inefficient and messy when updating the website. I discovered Jekyll, a framework that generates static and blog-aware sites which let me host my website for free on GitHub.</p>

            <p>Jekyll is written in Ruby, and allowed me to build my static website from dynamic components such as templates, liquid code and markdown. I made some basic sketches of how I wanted the website to look and using the tutorials from<a href="https://learn.cloudcannon.com/" target="_blank"> cloudcannon</a> and skills from the OneMonth course I started to build my website.</p>

            <div class="content-image">

            </div>
            <h6 class="caption">Check out my personal website<a href="/home.html"> here.</a></h6>

            <p>During this time, I also learnt how to use Flexbox and CSS Grids on Scrimba (it's very cool that Per was part of FAC in 2015).</p>

            <p>It was great developing with Jekyll and leading up to my first commit to GitHub in December 2018 I learnt:</p>

            <p>Using the additional skills in JavaScript and CSS I completely recoded my website to tidy up the code, add extra functionality and content, improve the styling and responsive design and built new sections. Most importantly the FAC one you see here! :)</p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible-button">Civil Engineering</button>
                <div class="collapsible-button-content">
                <p>In August 2012 I started my career as a civil engineer in Atkins Dubai based Ground Engineering team and was fortunate to work on some incredible multi-billion $$$ projects including<a href="https://corp.qr.com.qa/English/Projects/Pages/DohaMetro.aspx" target="_blank"> Doha Metro</a> and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh_Metro" target="_blank"> Riyadh Metro.</a></p>

                </div>
                <h6 class="caption">A very happy site engineer checking the seating in the Opera House</h6> 

                <p>I worked mainly in a techincal design role but I was also Assistant Project Manager on Doha Metro's Gold Line where I was responsible along with the Project Manager for a budget of over £1.3m and leading a team of over 40 people spread across three design centres in Dubai, Doha and Manila.</p>

                <p>I also spent six months on site as a Site Engineer on the incredible<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai_Opera" target="_blank"> Dubai Opera House</a> and worked in Xi'an for one of China's most prestigious rail design institutes on a three month secondment.</p>

                <p>In December 2016 after 4.5 years of professional development and a successful professional review one of my proudest achievement was becoming a chartered member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_Engineer_(UK)" target="_blank">CEng</a><a href="https://www.ice.org.uk/about-ice" target="_blank"> MICE</a>).</p>

                <div class="collapsible-button-content">
                <p>Becoming bilingual has become a huge passion project of mine. Seeing the joy and infinite opportunity that communcation can unlock all over the world was and continues to be one of my biggest inspirations.<br><br>

                After a 3 month secondment in Xi'an in 2015, I vowed to return to take on Mandarin and arrived for four months in winter 2018, passing my HSK2.<br><br>

                However, during my travels around Latin America in autumn 2017 I fell in love with Spanish and in November 2018 I relocated to Madrid to immerse myself in the language, eventually settling back in Colombia for a few months in July this year.<br><br>

                I've absolutely loved the process of learning through immersion and driving my own study. Instead of traditional classroom based learning I worked with a personal tutor to study situations such as dining out, directing a taxi driver or dating.<br><br>

                This context driven learning approach was so effective for me and in a month I was able to confidently use Spanish in important situations in Madrid (ordering tapas and beer) and my confidence skyrocketed.<br><br>

                I believe confidence is everything when learning another language and that using your daily experiences to dictate what you need to learn is the best way to improve it rapidly.</p>

                <p>When leaving Dubai I had a strong desire to explore new places, push myself outside of my comfort zone and hopefully in the process of getting lost have a few experiences that I'd remember for a long time.<br><br>

                Some of the most memorable experiences include volunteering in Vietnam, backpacking though South and Central America and attending weddings in Ireland, Spain and Colombia. You can check out some of the snaps <a href="/travel.html">here</a>.
